Each item is prefixed with one of the following letters:

 B bugfix
 C compatible expansion without adding new symbols
 I incompatible change
 N new function, method or variable in the API
 R general remark

Release 0.1 (2014-02-16):
 R initial release

Release 0.2 (2014-03-03):
 N Add a function nfc.(*Device).LastError()
 N Add a function nfc.(*Device).InitiatorDeselectTarget()
 B Fix incorrect handling in a couple of places
 C Improve and unify error strings
 B Fix issue #2

Release 1.0 (2014-04-06):
 R This major release is considered stable. The interface of this
   wrapper is stable until further notice.
 I Rename constants to reflect Go naming conventions
 I Change methods of type nfc.Device to use a value receiver
 B Fix an issue were copying structs of type nfc.Device could cause a
   pointer into unallocated memory to come into existence

Release 2.0 (2014-08-30)
 B Make this wrapper compile under Go 1.3 and newer.
 I Change the layout of some Target structures. This is needed to
   simplify the marshalling code. The new target structures also follow
   the underlying C structures more closely.
 I Some names where changed to match Go naming conventions. This was
   done now as I believe it is better to lump incompatibly changes into
   one release as much as possible.
 C Error strings were converted to lower case.
 B Some typos where fixed in comments.

Release 2.0.1 (2015-09-28)
 B Set device pointer to nil after calling nfc_close(), not before.

Release 2.0.2 (2016-01-14)
 B Fix error handling in (*Device).InitiatorSelectPassiveTarget()
 B Fix initData handling (ibid.), these fix issue #8
 R Improve documentation (ibid.)

Release 2.1.0 (2020-05-22)
 N Introduce a new function nfc.Device.SupportedBaudRatesTargetMode()
   wrapping the corresponding new function in the upcoming 1.7.2 release
   of the libnfc.
 C Bump libnfc dependency to version 1.7.2.
 C Allow nil Target parameter to
   function nfc.Device.InitiatorTargetIsPresent() as supported since
   release 1.7.1 of the libnfc.
 R adapt Go modules and discontinue the subdirectory scheme.

Release 2.1.1 (2020-05-22)
 N Provide Device.InitiatorPollTarget wrapping nfc_initiator_poll_target.
 N Add support for Thinfilm NFC Barcode targets
 N Add support for NFC ISO14443BiClass, i.e. HID iClass (Picopass) targets
 I Due to upstream changes, the value of the modulation type enumeration
   constants has changed.  This has been forgotton for the 2.1.0 release
   which is why this patch release is needed.

Release 2.1.2 (2020-05-22)
 I Fix Go import paths (sorry, this is my first time using go mod)

Release 2.1.3 (2020-05-22)
 I In reaction to the newly released libnfc 1.8.0 which fixes the ABI
   breakage, revert the enumeration order changes and retract releases
   2.1.0 to 2.1.2.
 N Requires libnfc version >= 1.8.0.

Release 2.1.4 (upcoming)
 I Following a rename of my github account, change import path.  The
   old import path still works for now but is not recommended for new
   developments.
 I Delete 2.0 directory with old library version.  It will still be
   available for import on old tool chains that aren't module aware.
