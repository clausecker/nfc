Each item is prefixed with one of the following letters:

 B bugfix
 C compatible expansion without adding new symbols
 I incompatible change
 N new function, method or variable in the API
 R general remark

Release 0.1 (2014-02-16):
 R initial release

Release 0.2 (2014-03-03):
 N Add a function nfc.(*Device).LastError()
 N Add a function nfc.(*Device).InitiatorDeselectTarget()
 B Fix incorrect handling in a couple of places
 C Improve and unify error strings
 B Fix issue #2

Release 1.0 (2014-04-06):
 R This major release is considered stable. The interface of this
   wrapper is stable until further notice.
 I Rename constants to reflect Go naming conventions
 I Change methods of type nfc.Device to use a value receiver
 B Fix an issue were copying structs of type nfc.Device could cause a
   pointer into unallocated memory to come into existence

Release 2.0 (2014-08-30)
 B Make this wrapper compile under Go 1.3 and newer.
 I Change the layout of some Target structures. This is needed to
   simplify the marshalling code. The new target structures also follow
   the underlying C structures more closely.
 I Some names where changed to match Go naming conventions. This was
   done now as I believe it is better to lump incompatibly changes into
   one release as much as possible.
 C Error strings were converted to lower case.
 B Some typos where fixed in comments.

Upcoming release 2.1
 N Introduce a new function nfc.Device.SupportedBaudRatesTargetMode()
   wrapping the corresponding new function in the upcoming 1.7.2 release
   of the libnfc.
 C Bump libnfc dependency to version 1.7.2.
 C Allow nil Target parameter to
   function nfc.Device.InitiatorTargetIsPresent() as supported since
   release 1.7.1 of the libnfc.
