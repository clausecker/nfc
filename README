This is a Go wrapper for the libnfc.

You need the following libnfc version to use this code:

    versions <= 2.0.2 need libnfc version 1.7.0 or later
    version  >= 2.1.0 need libnfc version 1.7.2 or later

The code has not been thoroughly tested yet. Please report any errors to
the project. The API is considered stable as of version 2.0 and will
probably not change in incompatible ways in the near future.

Version 2.0.2 and earlier of this wrapper have been developed before the
advent of Go modules.  For this reason, they use a weird homecooked
scheme for their versioning involving the 2.0 and latest directories.
These can safely be ignored for new developments.  Using Go modules,
only version 2.1.0 and later are available.

To use this library, install libnfc version 1.7.2 or newer and import

    github.com/fuzxxl/nfc

into your project.  This project uses go modules for versionning and
tries its best to follow the usual guidelines for interface stability.
